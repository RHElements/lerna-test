[PatternFly Elements](https://patternfly.github.io/patternfly-elements) is a collection of flexible and lightweight [Web Components](https://webcomponents.org), and the tools to build them. PatternFly Elements are:

- **Lightweight**: small file size, minimal boilerplate, no "framework-like" features.
- **Universal**: write once, use everywhere. PatternFly Elements work in React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS, anywhere HTML elements are used.
- **Themable**: Make overrides as needed via attributes or CSS variables

The result of these principles is that you can plug one set of components into a wide variety of applications; bringing UX consistency and developer familiarity to any web project.

A Yeoman generator is included for creating Web Components that meets these goals.

## Quick start

    git clone git@github.com:patternfly/patternfly-elements.git
    cd patternfly-elements
    npm install # this will take a while due to lerna bootstrap
    npm run storybook

The storybook script will launch the interactive demo pages.

_Notice: You will need to use [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v.7 or higher. Storybook *may* not work with Node v.10._
