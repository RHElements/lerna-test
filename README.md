# RHElements

The RHElements collection is a set of flexible and lightweight [Web Components][wc].

These are the goals of the RHElements project:

 - **minimalism**: small filesize, minimal boilerplate, no "framework-like" features.
 - **write once, use everywhere**: RHElements work in React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS, and more.

A recipe (yeoman generator) is included for creating Web Components that meets these goals.

## Quick-start

    git clone git@github.com:RHElements/rhelements.git
    cd rhelements
    npm install # this will take a while due to lerna bootstrap
    npm start
