# RHElements Number Element

## Build

    npm run build

## Demo

From the RHElements root directory, run:

    npm start

## Code style

Number (and all RHElements) use [Prettier][prettier] to auto-format JS and JSON.  The style rules get applied when you commit a change.  If you choose to, you can [integrate your editor][prettier-ed] with Prettier to have the style rules applied on every save.
