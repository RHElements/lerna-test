## Usage

```html
<pfe-button>
    <!-- Default slot -->
    <h2>This is pfe-button</h2>
    
</pfe-button>
```

### Accessibility
Explain how this component meets accessibility standards.

## Slots

- `namedSlot`: Describe each available slot and best practices around what markup it can contain.

## Attributes

- `attr`: Describe each available attribute and what function is serves.

## Events
Describe any events that are accessible external to the web component. There is no need to describe all the internal-only functions.


## Dependencies
Describe any dependent elements or libraries here too.

## Dev

    `npm start`

## Test

    `npm run test`

## Build

    `npm run build`

## Demo

From the PFElements root directory, run:

    `npm run demo`

## Code style

Button (and all PFElements) use [Prettier][prettier] to auto-format JS and JSON. The style rules get applied when you commit a change. If you choose to, you can [integrate your editor][prettier-ed] with Prettier to have the style rules applied on every save.
